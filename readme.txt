This is the BASIC source code for the first part of the game "Sundog."
Originally written for the TI-99/4 in 1982 & 1983, Sundog was probably
the first "real" program I wrote. For more information, check out the
description of the program at:

This version was reconstructed from memory as the original version is
long gone. You'll need a copy of chipmunk basic to run it; more info

It is provided without warranty and you'll likely have to reverse
engineer the code to solve it, but hey, that's sort of the fun of
BASIC adventure games, isn't it?
